# Mintbase Grant Proposal

- **Project Name:** Adaptive Blend - Skin Priority Profiles.
- **Team Name:** Adaptive Blend
- **Payment Address:** adaptiveblend.near
- **[Level](../README.md#level_slider-levels):** 1

## Project Overview : ðŸ“„
***Skin Priority Profiles** : Digital representations of usersâ€™ personalized skin priorities based on an initial 512 potential combinations.*

<br/>

Adaptive Blend is transforming skincare by prioritizing usersâ€™ real-time skin needs through ***Digitalâ€”Skin Priority Profiles***,  which anchor personalized skincare experiences, enable
data-driven decisions and foster engagement in a gamified Web3 ecosystem, **shifting focus from product-driven solutions to individual skin priorities.**


---
<br>

**The Problem** : The skincare industry is vast, yet highly impersonal. 

Consumers face:
  - Uncertainty in product selection.
    - *>$70/user/year wasted on mismatched products spending*
    - *> 2 hours spent researching per product*
  - Lack of personalized solutions
    - *>30 hours/user/year wasted managing allergic reactions and subpar results*
  - Difficulty tracking skincare progress.
    - *Users struggle to assess long-term improvements.*

<br>

***"The Core Problem: Skincare revolves around products rather than the unique needs of individual skin priorities."***

<br>




**The Vision** : Shifting Skincare to Skin Priorities.

<!--Adaptive Blend is on a mission to transform skincare by making usersâ€™ skin priorities the focal point.-->
Adaptive Blend redefines skincare by placing users at the center. By prioritizing real-time individual skin priorities, we empower users to control their skincare journeys with adaptive, data-driven tools that cater directly to their unique needs.

  - Personalized Skin Priority Profiles
    - ***Core of Personalization:** 512 unique combinations of skin concerns, goals, and characteristics ensure precise guidance.*
    - ***Data-Driven Insights:** Profiles adapt to usersâ€™ evolving needs, making skincare dynamic and personalized.*

  - AI-Powered Decision-Making
    - ***Product Compatibility Analysis:** <3s Evaluation of product compatibility based on individual profiles*
    - ***Product Recommendations:** Products efficacy-aligned to present skin priorities.*
    - ***Vendor Verification:** Verifies vendor authenticity using real-world feedback.*

  - Building a Gamified, Composable Ecosystem: 
    - *Routine tracking and performance evaluation.*
    - *Custom formulation creation tailored to user needs.*
    - *Secondary marketplaces for community-generated formulations.*


The ultimate goal is to build a *Composable Skincare Ecosystem*, blending Real-World Applications with Gamified, NFT-driven features, paving the way for collective intelligence in skincare.
 starting with compatibility analysis, routine tracking and evolving into a Crafting Station for custom formulations that users can digitally create, share and sell in a secondary marketplace.

**Integration into the Mintbase / NEAR Ecosystem:**
- **Mintbase :** For minting and managing NFT Skin Priority Profiles.
- **Mintbase GraphQL Indexer:**  To query NFT Metadata.
- **NEAR Protocol :** The foundational blockchain for our Smart Contracts. 

<br>


**Why Our Team is Interested :**
We are motivated to solve the inefficiencies of trial-and-error skincare, a process that costs consumers both time and money while delivering inconsistent results. We envision a world where every individual has access to personalized skincare that adapt and evolve with their needs. By leveraging Mintbase/NEAR, we demonstrate how web3 technologies can merge digital innovation and tangible consumer benefits, setting a new standard for transparency and personalization in skincare.

### Project Details
<!--The Technical Implementation-->
**Objective: Develop and Deploy **Skin Priority Profiles NFTs**, enabling personalized skincare experiences by encoding user-specific skin needs into a secure and composable digital format.**

***Note: The Skin Priority Profiles NFTs is the only part that will be developed as this Level 1 grant application, as shown on the milestones.***

The Foundation of the Adaptive Blend Ecosystem are the Skin Priority Profiles. These are Digital representations of usersâ€™ personalized skin priorities based on an initial 512 potential combinations. Each unique combination forms a Single Skin Profile, and minted as an NFT.

These NFTs encode 512 scientifically-defined skin priority combinations with deterministic precision, enabling :
  - Personalized product compatibility analysis and recommendation.
  - Gamified engagement mechanics.
  - Routine tracking and performance evaluation.
  - Secondary marketplace opportunities.
  - Interoperable data structures for long-term adaptability

This implementation establishes the critical infrastructure for Adaptive Blendâ€™s personalized and composable skincare ecosystem.
